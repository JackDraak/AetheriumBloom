  Key Strategic Insights:
  - ECS Bridge Strategy: Gradual migration from simple.rs to full modular system while
   maintaining functionality
  - "Maximum Chaos, Minimum Code": Single rules creating emergent complexity rather
  than complex systems
  - Performance-First: Maintaining 60+ FPS with thousands of entities through smart
  optimizations
  - Anti-UI Philosophy: Pure visual information display through entity properties

  4-Phase Evolution Plan:
  1. Phase 1 (6 days): ECS integration and system migration foundation
  2. Phase 2 (10 days): Prime beat engine + 11D AI + species system
  3. Phase 3 (12 days): Consciousness crystals + chaos events + mutations
  4. Phase 4 (15 days): Full reality distortion + advanced rendering + complete chaos

  Brilliant Technical Approaches:
  - Chaos Accumulation System: Click spawning → chaos buildup → automatic mutations
  - Emergent Complexity: Simple consciousness thresholds trigger complex behaviors
  - Event-Driven Architecture: Beat drops cascade through all systems simultaneously
  - Graceful Degradation: Performance monitoring with automatic feature scaling

  The plan honors both the minter agent's experimental vision (visual chaos, emergent
  behaviors, reality tears) and solid engineering principles (performance,
  maintainability, risk mitigation).
